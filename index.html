  <h2> School Experience:</h2>

  <b>
    <p> <i>My school experience </i> was pretty ordinary. Growing up
      asian in schools with little to no students of asian culture was easy in elementary school, 
      however, when I got older it was harder. In elementary school, it was fine because no
      one cared about race and it was easy to soialise, but when I entered middle
      school, suddenly it seperated me from others. <>Ive learned to live with this 
        and have made more diverse friend groups as a grew.  </p>

  <h2> Where I see Myself in 3 years: </h2>

 <b> <p> In 3 years I see myself still continuing my education. I don't have any colleges in mind at the moment but I do know that I will be in college. I'll probably be miserable since I heard people suffer in college but I like money so it will be worth it. </p>
